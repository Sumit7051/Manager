Book Manager API
Hey there! üëã This guide will walk you through how to get the Book Manager API up and running, and how to use its various endpoints step-by-step.

1. Getting Started: Setup and Run the Application
This section covers everything you need to do before you can start interacting with the API.

Step 1: Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have these installed on your system:

Java Development Kit (JDK) 21 or higher.

Apache Maven (which is already bundled if you cloned the project, but good to have if you're building from scratch).

Step 2: Clone the Repository

First, you'll need to get the project files onto your local machine.

Open your terminal or command prompt.

Run the following command:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git

(Remember to replace your-username and your-repo-name with your actual GitHub username and repository name.)

Navigate into the cloned directory:

cd your-repo-name

Step 3: Run the Spring Boot Application

Now that you have the code, let's start the API server.

Option A: Using an IDE (Recommended for Development)

Open your favorite Java IDE (like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code with Java extensions).

Import the project as a Maven project.

Locate the Manager.java file (it's usually in src/main/java/.../Manager.java).

Right-click on the main method within Manager.java and select "Run 'Manager.main()'".

Option B: Using the Terminal

Make sure you are in the root directory of your project (where the pom.xml file is located).

Execute the following command to start the application:

./mvnw spring-boot:run

You'll see logs in your terminal, and once it's ready, you'll typically see a message indicating that the application has started on port 8080. For example: Started Manager in X.XXX seconds (process running for X.XXX)

The API will now be accessible at http://localhost:8080.

2. API Usage Basics
Once the application is running, you can start making requests to its endpoints.

Tools for Interaction

You can use various tools to send HTTP requests to the API:

Postman: A popular desktop application for API testing.

Insomnia: Another great desktop API client.

curl: A command-line tool, perfect for quick testing. All examples below use curl.

Web Browser: For simple GET requests, you can paste the URL directly into your browser.

Base URL

All the API endpoints listed below start with this base URL: http://localhost:8080/Books

3. Detailed API Endpoints: Step-by-Step Guide
Let's go through each API endpoint with instructions and curl examples.

3.1. Add a New Book (POST /Books) ‚ûï

This is how you add a new book record to the system.

What it does: Creates a new book entry.

Method: POST

Endpoint: /Books

Content-Type: application/json (You must specify this in the header).

Request Body: You need to send a JSON object containing the book's id, title, author, and price.

{
    "id": 1,
    "title": "The Lord of the Rings",
    "author": "J.R.R. Tolkien",
    "price": 25.50
}

curl Example:

curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"id": 1, "title": "The Lord of the Rings", "author": "J.R.R. Tolkien", "price": 25.50}' http://localhost:8080/Books

Tip: After running this, the API will respond with the newly added book object.

3.2. Get All Books (GET /Books) üìö

Want to see all the books currently in the collection?

What it does: Retrieves a list of all books stored in the system.

Method: GET

Endpoint: /Books/{id} (Replace {id} with the actual ID, e.g., /Books/1)

curl Example (searching for "J.R.R. Tolkien"):

Note: J.R.R.%20Tolkien is the URL-encoded version of "J.R.R. Tolkien" (spaces become %20).
